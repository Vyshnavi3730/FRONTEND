    <h1>Web Development</h1>
    <p><span class="firstline">Web development involves creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications, encompassing tasks like coding, design, and database management, using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</span>Web development is the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves a combination of programming, design, and content management to create user-friendly, functional, and visually appealing online experiences. The process typically includes front-end development (focused on the user interface) and back-end development (handling servers, databases, and application logic). Technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React and Node.js are commonly used. As the digital landscape evolves, web development continues to innovate with trends like responsive design, progressive web apps, and artificial intelligence integration.</p>
